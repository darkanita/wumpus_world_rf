# The Project
The 4106 Term Project is your opportunity to showcase what you’ve learned in the course.  Your objective is to design and train an intelligent agent using at least one of the following techniques for an application of your choosing:

- Deep Q Learning
- Policy Gradient
- Actor Critic
- PPO
- Entropy Methods

You may use libraries that support these techniques (i.e. you do not need to code everything from scratch).  You can also do a variation on the WumpusWorld agent if you like. 

 
# Our project
We decided to do a modification of the WumpusWorld assignments such as:
- Exploring the use of entropy in the models
- Trying pretraining the neural net using the probabilistic agent from SCS 3547
- Try hyperparameter tuning to see if different hyperparameters would accelerate training
